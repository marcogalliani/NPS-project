# Analysis of USA presidential elections

Project for the course "Nonparametric statistics", fall semester A.Y. 2023/2024

This repository is structured as follows:
- `include` constains utilities that in multiple notebooks
- `data`contains, of course, the data (coming from [here](https://github.com/MEDSL/2018-elections-unoffical/tree/master))
- `docs` the guidelines for the project and some references I used for my work plus the report of the project and the slides used to present it
- `src` contains the actual analysis, divided into 3 macro steps: boring data-cleaning procedures with some data visualization, preliminary analysis using depth measures and permutational tests and at last regression
